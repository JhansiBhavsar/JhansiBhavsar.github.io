	<p class="heading">Compsci Week 1</p>
	<p>This week I learned how to make my website page, and do the basic coding for it, using sublime text. I explored the class website, downloaded the dalton software, and learned how to use github. I also made my person card. I was a little confused at first, but it is starting to make more sense the more I practice.</p>

	<p class="heading">Compsci Week 2</p>
	<p>This week I learned how to create new files and title these files. To title a new file, create the new file in sublime text and do command shift s, to name it. I also learned how to make sure my homepage linked to this journal. I learned how to link to another page, which is done by inserting a <a href=""></a> tag. I also learned what div tags and paragraph tags are, and also learned how to create and style text. <p>
	
	<p>Compsci Week 3<p>
		
	</p>This week I learned how to style the body of a page (the background of the page),which is done through putting the code in the style section and labeling it body and then background in the brackets. To change the background color you can just search the color you want. To alter the width and height you can just change the percent, so like width:50% and do the same for the height, and the same for top/bottom.    </p>


	</p>Compsci Week 4</p>
	<p>This week I learned how to use styling in coding. I learned how to use a z index, which is used to put divs in front of eachother (the more positive its closer out). I also learned how to position things, and that position absolute means that the divs are set at the left upper corner, and need to be moved using (px). Lastly, I learned that opacity is used with a percent, and can be used to make divs invisible/blend in.  </p>

	<p>Compsci Week 5<p>
		
	</p>This week I learned how to use java script and I also learned what an event listener is, which is a function that waits for an event to occur and then does something. So for my gift for my mom, I'm using an event listener because when you click on the small images they become big.  </p>
