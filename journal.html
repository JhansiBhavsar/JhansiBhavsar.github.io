	<p>Compsci Week 1</p>
	<p>This week I learned how to make my website page, and do the basic coding for it, using sublime text. I explored the class website, downloaded the dalton software, and learned how to use github. I also made my person card. I was a little confused at first, but it is starting to make more sense the more I practice.</p>

	<p>Compsci Week 2</p>
	<p>This week I made sure my homepage linked to this journal. I also learned what div tags and paragraph tags are, and also learned how to create and style text.  <p>
		
	</p>Compsci Week 3</p>
	<p>This week I learned what an animation is and learned how to make one. </p>
