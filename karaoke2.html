            Little darling<br>
            It's been a long, cold lonely winter<br>
            Little darling<br>
            It feels like years since it's been here<br>
            Here comes the sun<br>
            Here comes the sun,<br>
            And I say, It's all right<br>
            Little darling<br>
            The smiles returning to the faces<br>
            Little darling<br>
            It seems like years since it's been here<br>
            Here comes the sun<br>
            Here comes the sun,<br>
            And I say, It's all right<br>
            Sun, sun, sun, here it comes<br>
            Sun, sun, sun, here it comes<br>
            Sun, sun, sun, here it comes<br>
            Sun, sun, sun, here it comes<br>
            Sun, sun, sun, here it comes<br>
            Little darling<br>
            I feel that ice is slowly melting<br>
            Little darling<br>
            It seems like years since it's been clear<br>
            Here comes the sun<br>
            Here comes the sun,<br>
            And I say, It's all right<br>
            Here comes the sun<br>
            Here comes the sun<br>
            It's all right<br>
            It's all right<br>
